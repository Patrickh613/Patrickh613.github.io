<section class="history">

<p>The Electoral College and its procedure is established in the U.S. Constitution by Article II, Section 1, Clauses 2 and 4; and the Twelfth Amendment (which replaced Clause 3 after it was ratified in 1804). Under Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, the manner for choosing electors is determined by each state legislature, not directly by the federal government. Many state legislatures used to select their electors directly instead of using any form of popular vote, but the political parties in the various states now conduct their own separate elections to help choose their slate of electors.</p>



  <p>The nomination process, consisting of the primary elections and caucuses and the nominating conventions, was never specified in the Constitution, and was instead developed over time by the states and the political parties. The primary elections are staggered generally between January and June before the general election in November, while the nominating conventions are held in the summer.</p>

<footer>
The historycentral.com website looks great beaceuse it is oranized very well. What I mean by this is that it has great headers and footers and the paragraphs are also organized well. There are also lots of great picures and even videos to display and instruct on how to become involved with certain candidates. When looking at the source code I recognized image elements, table elements, and header/footer elements.
